***** Monkey2 v1.1.06b *****

Android min-sdk now 14 for android projects.


***** Monkey2 v1.1.06 *****

* App no longer renders when minimized/inactive.

* Added 'Internal' decl visibility to mx2cc, which means a decl is only visible to other decls within the same module.

* Namespace mojo3d now uses degrees. Namespaces monkey.math and std.geom still use radians.

* Mx2cc now tries to make docs for type extensions. No way to link to 'em yet. 

* Entity Position, Basis, Scale, Matrix etc properties are now in *world* space. Use LocalPosition, LocalBasis etc for local space versions. Ditto SetPosition, Setbasis, SetScale etc methods.

* Added subclasses for RigidBody: StaticBody, DynamicBody and KinematicBody, use these with New instead of RigidBody.


***** Monkey2 v1.1.05b *****

* Fixes a number of fairly critical GC bugs. GC is more aggressive now which has turned up a few 'lurkers'.

* Mojo 2d lighting now handles windows/devices larger than 1920,1080.

* Added 3d modules!


***** Monkey2 v1.1.05 *****

* Added std.requesters.OpenUrl support for android and ios.

* Added WIP assimp and bullet modules mainly for future use by mojo3d but its nice to have standalone versions of these.

* Added tinyfiledialog library for linux requesters, except for Proceed which uses kdialog as there's no equivalent in tfd.

* Added WIP MSVC support for faster compile times on windows. To enable, use 'MX2_USE_MSVC=1' in bin/env_windows.txt and rebuild all modules.
